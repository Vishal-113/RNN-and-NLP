        "Ans:  Think of a sentence like:\n",
        "\t\"Apple CEO Tim Cook visited New York in April.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "      POS tagging (Part-of-Speech tagging) tells us the role of each word in the sentence.\n",
        "      For example:\n",
        "\t   \"Apple\" → noun\n",
        "\t   \"visited\" → verb\n",
        "\t   \"in\" → preposition\n",
        "      NER (Named Entity Recognition) goes a step further and identifies real-world things in the sentence.\n",
        "      For example:\n",
        "\t\"Apple\" → ORGANIZATION\n",
        "\t\"Tim Cook\" → PERSON\n",
        "\t\"New York\" → LOCATION\n",
        "\t\"April\" → DATE\n",
        "\n",
        "     * POS tagging labels grammar.\n",

        "Ans: Financial News Monitoring:\n",
        "\tBanks or stock traders use NER to extract entities like company names, stock tickers, or dates from headlines and articles.\n",
        "\t\tExample: From a headline like\n",
        "\t\t\t\"Tesla announces new battery tech in Berlin on June 10\"\n",
        "\t\tNER can pull:\n",
        "\t\t\t\"Tesla\" → ORGANIZATION\n",
        "\t\t\t\"Berlin\" → LOCATION\n",
        "\t\t\t\"June 10\" → DATE\n",
